# User Data Uploader with Age Distribution Report

This Node.js project reads user data from a CSV file, converts it to JSON, stores it in a PostgreSQL or SQLite database using Sequelize, and then prints an age distribution report to the console.

---

## 🧩 Features

- Convert CSV input to structured JSON
- Extract standard user fields (`name`, `age`, `address`) and persist them
- Store remaining fields in `additional_info` as JSONB
- Use Sequelize ORM for database interaction
- Print age group percentage distribution:
  - `< 20`
  - `20 to 40`
  - `40 to 60`
  - `> 60`
